Project Nr.1

The first project made was based on the well known Titanic topic, where we had to predict which passengers survived the Titanic shipwreck.

Since is the first project made by me after the graduation of the courses I have made, the code is not that clean and it could be made better.

The fact that I have explained to myself and to anyone who is looking in the code as good as I could what I have done there I think is a good practice for me and for whoever is looking at it.

I have used a few classification machine learning models and also compile them onto cross validation (which is not helping too much since we do it later in the project).

On the test set I got a score of 78% prediction, which could be better but for my first one I am glad to have a bottom up project under my belt :)
